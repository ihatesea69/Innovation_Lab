	"content": "Requirements before deploying Innovation Sandbox on AWS Overview To deploy the Innovation Sandbox solution on AWS, you need to prepare some basic steps for your AWS environment. These steps include:\nIdentifying necessary AWS accounts Choosing AWS region Setting up AWS Organization Enabling the following: AWS IAM Identity Center AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) AWS CloudFormation StackSets Service Control Policies (SCPs) Estimated time: About 15-20 minutes (may take longer if you need to create new AWS accounts)\nIdentifying necessary AWS accounts Innovation Sandbox uses AWS Organizations features, helping you centrally manage and control your AWS environment when scaling. You need to choose an initial account (called the management account). There are two options for the initial account: Use an existing AWS account Create a new AWS account Note:\nIf you already have an AWS organization: the initial account is the existing management account. If creating a new AWS organization: you can use an independent AWS account (which will become the management account) or create a new account for this role. This account will be the management account for your entire AWS organization. Choosing AWS home Region All Innovation Sandbox components must be deployed in the same AWS region. The chosen region needs to meet: Full support for required services: AWS Organizations, IAM Identity Center, CloudFormation, DynamoDB, Lambda, CloudWatch, Secrets Manager, AppConfig. Where IAM Identity Center has been enabled. Accessible to all users expected to use the solution. When choosing AWS region, consider:\nGeographic location, distance to users, data storage requirements, network latency. Service costs and price differences between regions. Data transfer costs between regions. Price differences for each service. Setting up AWS Organizations You need an AWS organization with at least 4 accounts:\nManagement account Hub account Sandbox account 1 Sandbox account 2 You can add more sandbox accounts as needed.\nSteps to create a new AWS organization:\nLog in to AWS Management Console with administrative rights. Open AWS Organizations console and choose \u0026ldquo;Create an organization\u0026rdquo;. Verify management email according to instructions sent to mailbox. Add member accounts: Can create new accounts (provide name, root email, keep default IAM role). Or invite existing AWS accounts to the organization (by email or account ID). Repeat until you have at least 4 accounts with the following structure: Root ├── Management account ├── Hub account ├── Sandbox account 1 └── Sandbox account 2 Check in the Settings section of AWS Organizations console: Consolidated billing is enabled All features are enabled Enabling required services Before deploying the solution, ensure the following services are enabled on the management account:\nAWS IAM Identity Center: Centralized access management for AWS accounts.\nOpen IAM Identity Center in management account, check correct region, choose Enable. AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM): Securely share AWS resources between accounts in the organization.\nOpen RAM in management account, go to Settings, enable \u0026ldquo;Enable sharing with AWS Organizations\u0026rdquo;, save. CloudFormation StackSets trusted access: Manage CloudFormation stacks across multiple accounts/regions.\nOpen CloudFormation in management account, choose StackSets, enable \u0026ldquo;Enable trusted access\u0026rdquo;. Service Control Policies (SCPs): Manage access permissions across the entire organization.\nOpen AWS Organizations in management account, go to Policies, choose Service control policies, enable this feature.

Creating Lease Template Introduction to Lease Template Lease template is a set of parameters and rules defining how users access and use resources in Innovation Sandbox on AWS environment. This is a template for creating individual leases (controlled access sessions to cloud resources). Main components of lease template include:\nResource allocation: Define maximum budget that can be used during lease period. Duration: Determine maximum time a lease can be active. Approval process: Determine if manager approval is needed before granting lease. Alerts and thresholds: Set up alerts based on budget consumption or remaining time. You will create two types of templates:\nBasic template: Maximum budget $25, automatic approval, suitable for small projects and routine testing. Advanced template: Maximum budget $50, requires manager approval, suitable for large projects needing stricter control. Creating Basic Lease Template This guide helps you create lease template for accounts that don\u0026rsquo;t need manager approval. This template allows maximum budget $25, alert at $15 consumption, duration 168 hours (1 week), alert 24 hours before expiration.\nImplementation steps:\nOn Innovation Sandbox on AWS console, choose user profile in top right corner and choose Sign out. Log in with manager account. If first time logging in, use Forgot password function. If screen shows two tabs Accounts and Applications, choose Applications to enter application. You will see Innovation Sandbox welcome page. In navigation bar, choose Lease Templates. Choose Add new lease template. In Name field, enter: Basic.
